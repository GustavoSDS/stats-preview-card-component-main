## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the course of the project I learned a better use of html5 tags, use of display flex for greater control of my web pages.
In addition to learning the importance of the mobile firsts methodology. Which allows us to give higher priority to mobile devices, 
which are the ones that are used the most on a day-to-day basis.
For desktop development I learned to use media queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <main>

    <section>
    </section>

    <section>
    </section>

  </main>
```
```css
/*       Media queries for  desktop       */
@media screen and (min-width:1200px) {
    main{
        width: 1110px;
        height: 448px;
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
        margin: 178px auto;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

So far I am not completely familiar with flex displays, so I would like to continue learning more about it in future projects. As well as the use of media queries.
